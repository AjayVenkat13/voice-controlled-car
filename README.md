# voice-controlled-car
There are people who don’t know or who can’t ride a vehicle and travelling has become indispensable part of our lives. Therefore, instead of learning to drive, it is easy for such people to navigate the path for which they have to travel, this seems to be simpler and less laborious. Also the cart should detect obstacle such as wall, and must make the vehicle to stop. This makes travel safe and easy.  This project aims to automate such tasks, using carts programmed to follow commands of the user to travel using voice control and stop the cart in case of detecting any obstacles with the help of hardware and software tools.
